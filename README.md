# Michael Andrew's Personal Website - as part of a course to refresh HTML/CSS/JS skills in 2024

This website is built using HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript and includes sections for About Me, Skills, Projects, and Recommendations. The form at the end simulates a submission via JavaScript.

Files:
- index.html: Main HTML structure
- style.css: Styling of the website
- script.js: Form handling script
- icons and images as referenced

To update the skills or projects, edit the HTML in index.html directly.
